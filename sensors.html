          <h1>What is Sensors?</h1>
          <p>A sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and relays the information to other electronics, most commonly a computer processor.</p>
        <p>A sensor converts the physical action to be measured into an electrical equivalent and processes it so that the electrical signals can be easily sent and further processed. The sensor can output whether an object is present or not present (binary) or what measurement value has been reached (analog or digital).</p>
